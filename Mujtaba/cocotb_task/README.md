# COCOTB Test Benches for Multiplier and Divider

This folder contains the files of system verilog implementation of 16-bit Sequential Signed Multiplier and Unsigned Divider having Ready/Valid Handshake Protocol for better data transfer and its test bench implemented in python aimed to practice the test benches in cocotb.

## Problem 1: Implementing 16-bit Sequential Signed Multiplier with Ready/Valid Protocol using python test bench 

- **Folder:** `Multiplier_w_RV_w_cocotb`
- **Description:** Includes all files which implements the 16-bit Multiplier with reference model written in python language. Also read the `README.md` file of that folder for further assistance.

## Problem 2: Implementing 16-bit Sequential Unsigned Divider with Ready/Valid Protocol using python test bench

- **Folder:** `Restoring_w_cocotb`
- **Description:** Includes all files which implements the 16-bit Divider with reference model written in python language. Also read the `README.md` file of that folder for further assistance.
