#POWER CALCULATIONS
# Calculate power for a simple CMOS circuit
#calc_power procedure is defined taking three arguments capacitance,voltage and frequency.

# SIMPLE TIMING CALCULATION

set setup_time_ns 0.5 

#we want the maximum frequency in MHz (megahertz), so we need to convert the total time from nanoseconds to microseconds first so (/1000)
#measure the max_freq_mhz by formula --> 1/total_time(prop_delay_ns+setup_time_ns)/1000(microseconds)
