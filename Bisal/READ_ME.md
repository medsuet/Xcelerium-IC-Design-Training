# Xcelerium Training Code Repository
This repository contains code and resources for various training modules, including C programming, Makefiles, Tcl scripts, Assembly code, RISC-V, and Python.

## C Programming
C codes demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and techniques. It covers topics such as variables, structures, functions, and memory management.

## Makefile
Makefiles are used to automate the build process. This section provides examples of Makefiles used to compile and link C programs, manage dependencies, and execute build targets efficiently.

## Tcl Scripts
Tcl (Tool Command Language) scripts included here are designed for automating tasks and configuring applications. Examples show basic scripting for process automation and system configuration.

## Assembly Code
Assembly code examples illustrate low-level programming and system interaction. This section focuses on instruction sets, registers, and memory manipulation in assembly language and explores compilation options for riscv64 toolchain.

## RISC-V
This section features code and resources related to RISC-V architecture. It includes examples of RISC-V assembly language and simulations to understand the core concepts of this open-source processor architecture.

## Python
Python scripts in this repository cover a range of topics from basic syntax to advanced features. Examples demonstrate scripting for bit manipulation,cache simulator and multiplication and division concepts in python.

## NOTE
Feel free to explore each section and use the provided examples as a reference for your training and development needs.
