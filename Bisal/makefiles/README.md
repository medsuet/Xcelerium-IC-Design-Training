## Running Makefiles

A **Makefile** is a build script used by the `make` utility to automate the process of compiling and linking programs. It defines a set of rules to specify how files are built and their dependencies. To execute a Makefile:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Makefile.
3. Run the command:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
   This will execute the default target specified in the Makefile. To run a specific target, use:
    ```bash
    make <target>
    ```

## Running Tcl Scripts

**Tcl (Tool Command Language)** is a scripting language used for automating tasks and configuring applications. To execute a Tcl script:

1. Ensure you have Tcl installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Tcl script.
4. Run the command:
    ```bash
    tclsh <script.tcl>
    ```
   Replace `<script.tcl>` with the name of your Tcl script file.
