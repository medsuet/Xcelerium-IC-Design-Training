# Digital Design and Verification Training

## Objective
This training aims to help you understand and implement core concepts in digital systems design and computer architecture. It bridges the gap between high-level algorithm implementation in Python and hardware design.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Python
- Text editor (e.g., nano, vim, or gedit)

## Files Included
- `cacheSimulator.py`
- `division.py`
- `multiplier.py`

## Description of Files
### `cacheSimulator.py`
This file implements a simple cache simulator that models the behavior of a direct-mapped cache.

### `division.py`
This file implements the 32-bit unsigned non-restoring division algorithm.

### `multiplier.py`
This file implements the 32-bit Boothâ€™s Multiplier algorithm.

## How to Run

### `cacheSimulator.py`
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `cacheSimulator.py` file.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python cacheSimulator.py
