## Introduction
This lab focuses on applying advanced concepts in C programming.
## Compilation
``` bash
cd xce_lab2
```

To compile all the C files and create executables, run:

```bash
make
```
This command will generate the following executables:
- memoryMaze
- lab2
- boothMultiplier
## Running Executables
To run all the generated executables sequentially, use:
```bash
make run
```
To run a specific executable, use one of the following commands:
### Run lab2:
```bash
make run-lab2
```
### Run memoryMaze:
```bash
make run-memoryMaze
```
### Run boothMultiplier:
```bash
make run-boothMultiplier
```
## Clean Up
To clean up the directory by removing object files and executables, run:
```bash
make clean
```
## Exercises

### Part 1: Basic Operations
- **Function Definitions**: Implement basic arithmetic operations.
  - `add`: Adds two integers.
  - `subtract`: Subtracts the second integer from the first.
  - `multiply`: Multiplies two integers.
  - `divide`: Divides the first integer by the second (if the second is not zero).

### Part 2: Structures
- **Student Structure**
- **Department Structure**
- **University Structure** 

### Part 3: Pointers and Functions
- **Function Pointers**: Define and use function pointers for arithmetic operations.

### Part 4: Linked List
- **Linked List Operations**:
  - `insertAtBeginning`: Insert a node at the beginning of the list.
  - `deleteByValue`: Delete a node by its value.
  - `printList`: Print all the elements in the list.

### Part 5: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **Dynamic Array**: Create and manipulate a dynamically allocated array.

### Part 6: Unions
- **Union Usage**: Demonstrate the use of unions to store different data types.

### Part 7: File I/O
- **File Operations**:
  - `writeStudentToFile`: Write student information to a text file.
  - `readStudentFromFile`: Read student information from a text file.
  - `writeStudentToBinaryFile`: Write student information to a binary file.
  - `readStudentFromBinaryFile`: Read student information from a binary file.
  - `logMessage`: Log messages to a file.
  - `displayLog`: Display the contents of the log file.

# Lab 3 - Shell Scripting & MakeFile
This lab is designed to provide hands-on experience with Linux shell scripting and makefiles

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**
  Enter the task and the part you want to execute. a and b are the tasks and its parts respectively.

    ```sh
    chmod +x ./taska_b.sh
    ```

2. **Execution**
    ```sh
    ./taska_b.sh
    ```
## Task 5 - Makefiles
This project demonstrates the use of a Makefile for compiling and managing a C program with `main.c` and `functions.c`. It handles multiple source files automatically and implements dependency tracking for header files.


### Makefile Targets

### Basic Targets

- `all`: Default target that compiles the source files into an executable named `main`.
- `clean`: Removes all object files (`*.o`), dependency files (`*.d`), and the executable `main`.

### Advanced Targets

- `debug`: Compiles the source files with debugging symbols (`-g` flag).
- `%.o`: Compiles individual source files into object files.
- `%.d`: Generates dependency files for the source files.

### Usage

#### To use the Makefile
 run the following command in the terminal:

- Compile the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```
- Clean the project:
  ```sh
  make clean
  ```
-  Compile with debugging symbols:
   ```sh
   make debug
   ```

## Build and Run

To build and run the programs, use the provided `Makefile`. The Makefile includes rules to assemble, link, and run the programs using Spike.

### Build All Programs
move to directory
``` bash
cd xce_lab6_assembly
```
```bash
make all 
```

### Run a Specific Program

To run a specific program, set the `PROG` variable: x could be 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

```bash
make run PROG=Problems/Problem_x/problem_x
```
To run a specific Task, set the `PROG` variable: x could be 1,2 and 3.
```bash
make run PROG=Tasks/task_x
```
### Debug a Specific Program
To debug a specific program, set the `PROG` variable and use the debug rule:
Replace x with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
```bash
make debug PROG=Problems/Problem_x/problem_x
```
To debug a specific task, set `PROG` variable, set x as 1,2 and 3. Use the debug rule:
```bash
make debug PROG=Tasks/task_x 
```
### Clean Up
To clean up the generated files:
```bash
make clean

```
# LAB 7 - Python
This lab contains three tasks:
- problem1.py
- problem2.py
- cacheSimulator.py
## Scripts Description
### problem1.py
This script performs multiplication using Booth's Multiplier algorithm.

### problem2.py
This script performs division using non-restoring division algorithm.

### cacheSimulator.py

This script simulates a direct-mapped cache. It models the behavior of a direct-mapped cache handles read and write operations, and tracks hits and misses.

## Running the Scripts

### Using the Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided to simplify running the scripts. The `Makefile` includes targets to run each script individually or all of them together.

Navigate to the directory containing python scripts
```bash
cd xce_lab7
```
- To run all scripts:
```bash
make all
```
- To run problem1.py:
```bash
make run_problem1
```
- To run problem2.py:
```bash
make run_problem2
```
- To run cacheSimulator.py:
```bash
make run_cache_simulator
```

## Clean Up
```bash
make clean
```
