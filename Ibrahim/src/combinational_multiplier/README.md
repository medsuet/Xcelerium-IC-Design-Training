## Overview

This design implements a 16-bit combinational logic multiplier for signed numbers. The multiplier processes two 16-bit signed integers, producing a 32-bit signed product. The inputs are denoted as `A0` to `A15` for the multiplicand and `B0` to `B15` for the multiplier. The resulting product is represented by `P0` to `P31`.

## Implementation Details

### Partial Products Generation

1. **Bitwise AND Operations:**
   - Each partial product is generated by performing bitwise AND operations between corresponding bits of the multiplicand and multiplier. This operation creates the initial partial products which are essential for the final multiplication result.

2. **Sign Bit Handling:**
   - Instead of extending the bits for each partial product, the most significant bit (MSB) of each partial product is generated using a NAND operation. This approach ensures that the sign bit is correctly handled and that the multiplication operation accounts for signed numbers properly.

### Special Handling of the Last Partial Product

- **NAND and AND Operations:**
  - For the last partial product, all bits are generated using NAND operations except for the MSB, which is generated using an AND operation. This specific handling ensures that the final product accurately reflects the signed multiplication result, accommodating the proper sign extension.

## Significance

- **Handling Negative Numbers:**
  - The use of NAND and NOT operations for the MSB of partial products ensures that negative numbers are correctly processed. This method simplifies the hardware design by directly addressing sign extension through logical operations, rather than requiring additional bit extensions.

- **Simplified Hardware Implementation:**
  - This approach avoids the complexity of bit extension for each partial product and focuses on logical operations to handle signed numbers. It results in a more efficient and straightforward hardware implementation, providing consistent and accurate results.

By employing this design, the 16-bit signed combinational logic multiplier efficiently manages sign extension and produces correct multiplication results, making it a robust solution for signed integer operations in digital systems.

## Project Files

- `signed_comb_multiplier.sv`: SystemVerilog module for the signed multiplier.
- `signed_comb_multiplier_tb.sv`: SystemVerilog testbench for the multiplier.
## Makefile
The provided `Makefile` automates the process of compiling, simulating, and viewing the simulation results.

## Makefile Targets

- **`all`**: The default target, which compiles the design, runs the simulation, and then views the results.
- **`compile`**: Compiles the SystemVerilog files using `iverilog`.
- **`simulate`**: Runs the simulation using `vvp`.
- **`view`**: Opens the waveform file using `gtkwave`.
- **`clean`**: Removes generated files (`sim` and `waveform.vcd`).
