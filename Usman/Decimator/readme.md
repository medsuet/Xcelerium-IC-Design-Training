# Decimator
### calculations

Num of filters = decimation factor
   
output size    =   (num of samples + num of tapsâˆ’1)/decimation factor 

output size    =     16 +16 -1/2  = 15 
### Bit Growth

output bits    =  2*input bits + log2(num of samples/deci factor)  //log due to bit growth

output bits    =  2*32 + 3 = 67 

### Fix Point

we are applying Fix Point in test bench.
sample width = 32bits -> integer part = 24bits  & Fractional part = 8bits.
step 1 -> convert numbers into integer
tep 2 -> perform calculation
step 3 -> convert back it into original form
      
3.2 x 0.1
step1 -> 32 x 1
step2 -> 32
step  -> 0.32
            
In test bench we are multiplying number by 2^(Fractional part) to convert it into integer.
Then giving it to the module.
dividing it by 2^(Fractional part) after receiving it when outout valid becomes high.
