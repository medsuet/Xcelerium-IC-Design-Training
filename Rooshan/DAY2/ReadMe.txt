DAY2:
Lab Experiment - C Language
Clone the rpository:'https://github.com/RooshanKhan/Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training'
I have made separate files for each task.
Use a C compiler such as 'gcc' to run these codes.
Use this command in Ubuntu 'gcc -o Example Example.c' to compile the codes individually.
Then Use this command to run the compiled code file './Example'
