DAY2:
Lab Experiment - Python Language
Clone the repository:'https://github.com/RooshanKhan/Xcelerium-IC-Design-Training'
I have made separate files for each task.
Use VS Code to run these files.
Use the command "python Example.py" to run these python files. Replace Example with name of the file you want to run.
