# 16-bit Signed Sequential Multiplier Project

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a sequential multiplier. A sequential multiplier is a digital circuit that multiplies two binary numbers in a sequential manner, producing the result within 17-18 clock cycles. This type of multiplier is generally simpler and requires less hardware compared to parallel multipliers, but it takes more clock cycles to produce the result.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: This directory contains the source code for the sequential multiplier.
- **test/**: This directory contains the testbenches and other files required for testing the sequential multiplier.
- **docs/**: This directory contains the design of the top-module, datapath and controller.
- **log/**: This directory contains the output_result file after running the simulation.

## Features

- **Sequential Operation**: The multiplier performs multiplication in a sequence of steps, making it efficient in terms of hardware utilization.
- **Configurable Bit-width**: The bit-width of the multiplicand and multiplier can be configured as per requirements but you must have to change its shift register.
- **Start and Ready Signals**: The design includes start and ready signals to control the operation of the multiplier.

## Design Details

Following is the Top Module of the Sequential Multiplier:

![Top Module](docs/Topmodule.png)

The sequential multiplier is designed using a state machine that controls the multiplication process. The primary components include:

1. **Multiplicand Register**: Stores the multiplicand value.
2. **Multiplier Shift Register**: Stores the multiplier value.
3. **Partial Product Register**: Stores the intermediate and final product values.
4. **Control Unit**: Manages the states and operations of the multiplier.

The following is the Datapath of the sequential multiplier:

### States of the Control Unit

1. **Idle**: Waiting for the start signal.
2. **Calc**: Performing the multiplication over multiple clock cycles.

The following is the Controller of the sequential multiplier:
