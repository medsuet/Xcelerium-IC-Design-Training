# Digital Design and Verification Training - RISC-V Assembly Programming

## Overview

This repository contains RISC-V assembly programming exercises aimed at gaining practical experience with the RISC-V ISA, Spike simulator, and debugging techniques.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Absolute Difference

- **Objective:** Implement a program in RISC-V assembly to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers.

### Task 2: Count Set Bits

- **Objective:** Implement a function in RISC-V assembly to count the number of set bits in a 32-bit word.

### Task 3: Factorial Calculation

- **Objective:** Implement a program in RISC-V assembly to calculate the factorial of a number.

### Task 4: Array Reversal

- **Objective:** Implement a program in RISC-V assembly to reverse an array in-place.

### Task 5: Insertion Sort

- **Objective:** Implement an insertion sort algorithm in RISC-V assembly for sorting an array.

### Task 6: Restoring Division Algorithm

- **Objective:** Write an assembly program for the restoring division algorithm in RISC-V assembly language. Compare its optimization with a C implementation.

### Task 7: Bit Manipulation

- **Objective:** Implement an assembly program to set or clear any bit in a 32-bit number. Compare its optimization with a corresponding C code.

### Task 8: Non-Restoring Division

- **Objective:** Write an assembly program for non-restoring 32-bit unsigned division in RISC-V assembly. Compare its optimization with a C implementation.


## Usage

### Compiling
To compile all executables:

```sh

make all

```
### Runnig a specific Executable
To run a specific executable with Spike:

```sh

make run EXECUTABLE=executable_name

```
### Debugging a specific Executable
To debug a specific executable with Spike:
```sh
make debug EXECUTABLE=executable_name

```
### Cleaning
    ```sh

    make clean

    ```
