# Xcelerium Training

## Objective 
The objective of this training is to enhance the skills of the students and equip them with the skill set needed for industrial projects.

## Description
- This repository is structured with separate folders for each lab task to enhance the students' skill set.
- Each lab folder contains:
  - A **Makefile** to execute the tasks.
  - A **README.md** that provides descriptions about each task and includes Makefile commands to run the tasks.
  - A **gitignore file** to manage version control exclusions and ensure clean repositories.


### Usage
Each `README.md` file within the lab folders provides specific instructions on how to compile, run, and understand the tasks associated with that lab. Follow the instructions in each lab's `README.md` to execute the tasks effectively.
