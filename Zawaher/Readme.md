## Description
- This repository is structured with separate folders for each lab task to enhance the students' skill set.
- Each lab folder contains:
  - A **Makefile** to execute the tasks.
  - A **README.md** that provides descriptions about each task and includes Makefile commands to run the tasks.
  - A **gitignore file** to manage version control exclusions and ensure clean repositories.
