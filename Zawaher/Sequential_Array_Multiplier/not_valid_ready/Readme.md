# 16x16 Signed Array Multiplier 

## Overview
  This repository contains an implementation of 16 bit signed array multiplier sequentially but can be used for any size by changing the width of inputs and output in the header file.

## Languages Used
  * System Verilog
  * C++
  * Makefile 


## Environments Used

  * Linux Ubuntu 22.04.2

# System Design Overview

  Representation of architecture through clear block diagrams is shown below.
## Pinout Diagram
The Pinout diagram of the signed array  multiplier  is given below.

***Note:***
- The inputs that are not written in the STG are treated as don't  care .
- The outputs that are not written  in the STG are treated as zero.

# Getting Started



## Installation of Vivado  

Install [Vivado](https://github.com/ALI11-2000/Vivado-Installation) and [Verilator](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html). Follow the instructions provided in the corresponding links to build these tools.

## Build Model and Run Simulation

To build Signed Combinational Multiplier, use the provided Makefile. Follow the steps below for simulation using Verilator or Vivado.

### Simulation with Verilator
Run the following command to simulate using Verilator:

```markdown
  make verilator
```


To view the waveform generated by Verilator, execute:

```markdown
make ver_waves
 ```
### Simulation with Vivado
For simulation on vivado run the following command:

```markdown
make 
```

The waves on vivado will be created that can be viewed by running

```markdown
make viv_waves
``` 

# Successful Implementation

## Implementation with Verilator

Upon successful execution of the `make verilator` command, the terminal log output for Uart Transmitter and Receiver, is presented below:

### Implementation with Vivado

Running the `make vivado` command generates the terminal log output as shown below:
