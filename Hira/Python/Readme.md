# Arithmetic and Cache Mapping Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts for various arithmetic operations and a direct mapping cache implementation.

## Files

### Direct_Mapping_Cache.py

This script implements a direct mapping cache. It simulates the behavior of a cache memory in a computer system using the direct mapping technique.

#### Usage
To run the script and see the direct mapping cache operations in action, use the following command:



```bash
python3 Direct_Mapping_Cache.py



### division.py
This script performs division operations. It includes functions to handle various division tasks, possibly including error handling for division by zero.


```bash
python3 division.py


### multiplier.py
This script performs multiplication operations. It includes functions to handle various multiplication tasks, potentially including large number multiplications and optimizations

```bash
python3 multiplier.py
