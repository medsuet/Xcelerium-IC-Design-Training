## Run
To run: 

`make <scriptname>`

The makefile supports 'shorthand notation' for running scripts. Scripts can be run using initials in their name. For example, `make cache_simulator` is same as `make cs`. (In case of a clash i.e different files having same initials, you have to write full names.)

If just `make` or `make help` is written, this readme file is displayed.

### Requirements
Python 3: To check, write python --version
