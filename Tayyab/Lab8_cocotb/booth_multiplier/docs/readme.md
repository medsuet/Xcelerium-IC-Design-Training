# Booth multiplier

Multiplier unit using Booth's multipler algorithem

```
Parameters: NUMBITS     : number of bits (width) of multiplier and multiplicand

Inputs: clk             : clock signal
        reset           : reset signal (active low)
        num_a, num_b    : <NUMBITS> wide multiplier and multiplicand.
                            Must be stable for 1 clock cycle after start signal.
        valid_scr       : valid signal from source signaling availability of inputs (num_a, num_b)
        ready_dst       : ready signal from detination signaling that output (porduct) has been processed

Outputs: ready           : set to 1 when result (product) is available
         product         : <2*NUMBITS> wide result of num_a * num_b
         valid_dst       : valid signal to destination signaling availability of output (product)
         ready_scr       : ready signal to source signaling that inputs (num_a, num_b) has been processed

Supports valid/ready interface.

### Reference model
Python reference model is preset in sim/ref_models

### Run tests
Cocotb is used for simulation. The python reference model and testbench are used.

Python testbench: [boothmultiplier_tb.py](../sim/boothmultiplier_tb.py)\
The python testbench runs directed and random tests on the unit. 
Default directed test pairs (multiplier, multiplicand) are [(-1,-1),(2,3),(3,-2),(-6,6)] and default number of random tests is 1000.

Define new directed tests, add a new (multiplier, multiplicand) tuple to python list directed_test_pairs (testbench, line 18).\
To change number of random tests, set value of NUM_RAND_TESTS constant (testbench, line 19).

`make`\
Runs cocotb simulation.

`clean`\
Cleans build files.
