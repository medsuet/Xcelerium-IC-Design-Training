# M-Booth Sequential Multiplier with Handshake Val-Ready Interface

## Overview

This project implements an M-Booth sequential multiplier with a handshake `val-ready` interface. The multiplier consists of two main modules: the `Datapath` and the `Controller`, which are integrated into the top module `Seq_Mul_top`.

## Files

1. **Makefile**: Used for compiling and simulating the Verilog code.
2. **Controller Module**: Manages the state transitions and control signals.
3. **Datapath Module**: Executes the arithmetic operations and shifts required for multiplication.
4. **Top Module**: Integrates the `Datapath` and `Controller` modules.

## Handshake Protocol

The handshake protocol ensures that data is correctly transferred between the source and destination with synchronization. Hereâ€™s how it works in this multiplier:

1. **Idle State (S0)**:
   - When `src_val` is zero, the system remains idle and performs no operations.
   - When `src_val` and `src_ready` both become 1, the multiplication process starts. This indicates that the source has valid data and the system is ready to process it.

2. **Multiplication State (S1)**:
   - The system performs the M-Booth multiplication algorithm.
   - During this state, the multiplication proceeds until the computation is complete.
   - The completion of counting is indicated by `count_comp`.

3. **Output State (S2)**:
   - Once the multiplication is done, `dest_val` is set to 1, indicating that the destination data is valid.
   - The output will only be provided after the handshake is complete, i.e., when `dest_ready` becomes 1. This ensures that the destination is ready to receive the data before it is sent.

## Makefile

The provided Makefile includes targets to compile and simulate the Verilog code:

- **IVERILOG**: Compiler used (`iverilog`).
- **VVP**: Simulator used (`vvp`).
- **MULTIPLIER_VERILOG_FILES**: List of Verilog source files.
- **MULTIPLIER_OUTPUT_FILE**: Output file generated by the compiler.

Targets:
- `all`: Default target.
- `mult`: Target to compile and simulate the multiplier.
- `clean`: Target to clean up generated files.

## Controller Module

The controller manages the state transitions of the multiplier. It has three states:
- **S0 (Idle)**: Waits for `src_val` to start the multiplication.
- **S1 (Multiplication)**: Performs the M-Booth multiplication.
- **S2 (Output)**: Outputs the result when `dest_ready` is asserted.

## Datapath Module

The datapath performs the arithmetic operations and shifts required for the M-Booth multiplication.


## Top Module

The top module integrates the `Datapath` and `Controller` modules.

## Usage

1. **Compile and Simulate**:
   ```sh
   make mult
