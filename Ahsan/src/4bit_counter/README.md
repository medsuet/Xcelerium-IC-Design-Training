## Files

- **src/Counter.sv**: Contains the Verilog code for the 4-bit counter module.
- **test/tb.sv**: Contains the testbench for simulating the 4-bit counter module.
- **Makefile**: Makefile to compile and simulate the 4-bit counter module.
- **README.md**: This README file.

## Prerequisites

To compile and simulate the Verilog code, you need to have the following tools installed:

- **Icarus Verilog**: An open-source Verilog simulation and synthesis tool.
- **VVP**: A program that executes the compiled Verilog code.

## Usage

### Compilation and Simulation

To compile and simulate the 4-bit counter module, run the following command in the terminal:
```
make

###cleanup
```
make clean
