==========Code Description==========
This code contains three parts.
1- How to calculate time period in nanoseconds using frequency in MHz.
Formula Used:
    T(ns)=1000/f(MHz)

2- A procedure that takes capacitance in picofarad, voltage in V and frequency in MHz as arguments 
and calculates the power in microWatts.
Formula Used:
    Power(uW)=capacitance(pF)*voltage(V)*voltage(V)*f(MHz)

3- Calculate the max frequency in MHz using propagational delay(ns) and setup time(ns)
Formula Used:
    Max_f=1000/(prop_delay+setup_time)

4- Calculate number of cycle using f(MHz) and time period(ns)
Formula Used:
    no of cycles=f(MHz)*1000/t(ns)

Errors in given code:
1- Line # 7 should be ended with a backslash or curly bracket in line # 8 should be in line # 7.

2- Calculated power should be in microWatts not in miliWatts

==========Output==========
Clock period: 10.0 ns
Power consumption: 1439.9999999999998 uW
Maximum frequency: 333.3333333333333 MHz
Number of cycles are 10000.0

Floating Point precision issue: The output should be 1440 but it is 1439.9999999999998. To resolve it use format command:
format "%.2f" power_uW

Advantages:

More Readable
Reuseability
Easy to debug code as we have to debug and test that specific procedure
