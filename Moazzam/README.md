Complete!<br>
All the .c file is run by using gcc command<br>
like: <br>
gcc -o FILE FILE_Name.c  //FILE_Nmae is name of that file<br>
./FILE                   //to run it<br>

**For runing python file on ubuntu terminal:** `python3 file_name.py` <br>
**Booth_multiplier in python**
- Use numpy for signed and unsigned 32-bits and 64-bits number
- Program work under the rule of [BOOTH_MULTIPLIER] (https://www.javatpoint.com/booths-multiplication-algorithm-in-coa)
- Also verify on the random number and number of tests depend on user input.

**Non_Restoring_Division in python**
- For making 32-bit number, mask the number with 0xffffffff
- program work under the the rule of [NNON_RESTROING_DIVISION] (https://www.javatpoint.com/non-restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer)
- Also verify on the random unsign number and number of tests depend on user input.

**Cache Simulator in python**
- Cache simulator should model a direct-mapped cache with 128 cache lines
- Initialize the parameter for cache like block_size, cache_lines, cache size
- Initialize the cache by reset which put vaild_bits = 0, tags and data = NONE
- Do the read and write operation the tell about cache hit or miss
- Also have funtion which give you total hits and miss in cache.
