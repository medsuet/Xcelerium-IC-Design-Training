## Signed_Multiplier
In this module i have implemented a signed multiplier which can multiply every signed <br>
number with signed/unsigned,its also multiply signed with signed.<br>
### Files: <br>
In this portin their are four files.<br>
**src**<br>
My src fils consist up all source files with extesion *.sv* lke *cominational_multiplier.sv* <br>
**tests**<br>
My tests fils consist up test_bench to verify my code with extesion *.sv* and my file name is <br>
*cominational_multiplier_tb.sv* <br>
**docs**<br>
My docs fils consist up diagrames of my modules.<br>
**draw.io**<br>
my draw.io diagrame consist up two diagrams with name *16x16 signed multiplier-Page-1.drawio.png*
and my 2nd diagrame with name *16x16 signed multiplier-Page-2.drawio.png* basically my 2nd <br>
diagram is reduced and easy as compared to first one.<br>
#### Makefile <br>
I have aslo added *Makefile* so that i can directly execute my code with makefile.<br>
### Usage <br>
*Compilation and Simulation.* <br>
To compile and simulate the signed multiplier module, run the following command on terminal:<br>
*make* <br>

### Cleanup<br>
for cleanup<br>
*make clean*<br>
