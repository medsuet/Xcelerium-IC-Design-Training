## 4-bit counter
In this module i have implemented a 4-bit counter which counts from 0 to 13(MAX_NUMBER). <br>
when count ==13 i send a clear signal to start from 0.<br>
### Files: <br>
In this portin their are four files.<br>
**src**<br>
My src fils consist up source codes with extesion *.sv* lke *counter.sv* <br>
**tests**<br>
My tests fils consist up test_bench to verify my code with extesion *.sv* and my file name is <br>
*counter_tb.sv* <br>
**docs**<br>
My docs fils consist up simulation diagrame.<br>
**modeslsim_wave** <br>
Our modelsim simulation waveforom with name *modelsim_waveform.png* <br>
**wavedrom_wave** <br>
I have made a sketch of counter on wavedrom with name *output_code_waveform.png* and my both <br> waveforms are exactly matching.<br>
