# Xcelerium-IC-Designn-Training
This repo basically consist up all modules in sequence. <br>
## module_00 (Basic Setting)
Basic setting of linux installation,shell,vim,nano etc..
## module_01 (Basic C Language)
In this module i have code all task seperately as i have mentioned. <br>
But I have also putt all task in file name **all_task_exp1.c** <br>
**Running Files:** <br>
*gcc -o a file_name.c* <br>
*./a* <br>
## module_02 (Advanced C Language)
I have followed a similar structure in this file as i have followed in **module_01.** <br>
## module_03 ( Shell Scripting & MakeFile)
In this module I have mde *seperate folder* related to each task.<br>
for example our first task is *Basic Shell Scripting* so that i have made a folder for this with name **task_01 basic_shell_scripting** and son on ffor other tasks.<br>
In order to run each task we have to putt these commands,<br>
**Commands!** <br>
*make* <br>
*./Makefile* <br>
Similary for all other tasks.<br>
## module_04 (Github Setting)
*Complete.* <br>
## module_05 (TCL Programming)
All codes are running with proper modifications.<br>
## module_06 (Lab Experiment- Introduction to RISCV Assembly Programming)
In first portion of this module i have added two basic example whichhave already been provided in module. <br>
I also added linker and create a **make file** so that i can debug my assembly programmes in **spike**. <br>
### Problems:
**Basic commands to run any problem:** <br>
1.*make filename without extension*  <br>
2.*make debug* <br>
3.*make clean* <br>
**Description:**<br>
 In this section i have added first five task of problem section part.<br>
 they all can be run via necessary commnds in terminal which i have already been put above.<br>
 
### Tasks:
1.my first task was to implement non-restoring division algorithm both in C and in RISC-V assembly.<br>
I have implemned it via both ways.<br>
**C file name:** <br>
*non_restoring_division_algorithm.c* <br>
**Assembly file name:**<br>
*assembly_non_restoring_division_algorithm.s*<br>

2.my 2nd task was to set and clear any bit in 32-bit number both in C and in RISC-V assembly.<br>
I have implemned it via both ways.<br>
**C file name:** <br>
*setting_and_clearing_bit.c* <br>
**Assembly file name:**<br>
*assembly_setting_and_clearing_bit.s* <br>

3.my 3rd task was to implement restoring division algorithm both in C and in RISC-V assembly.<br>
I have implemned it via both ways.<br>
**C file name:** <br>
*restoring_division_algorithm.c* <br>
**Assembly file name:**<br>
*assembly_restoring_division_algorithm.s* <br>

## module_07 (Lab Experiment Python)
In this module i have implemented my previous tasks into python.<br>
### Problems:
1.Implement 32-bit Boothâ€™s Multiplier in python.<br>
**filename.** <br>
**Note:** for clarification i have also added my c file here.<br>
*python_booth_multiplier.py* <br>
2.Implement 32-bit unsigned non-restoring division algorithm in python.<br>
**filename.** <br>
*non_restoring_division_algorithm.py* <br>
## Tasks:
1.In this task i have to make a cache simulator in python.<br>
**filename.**<br>
*cache_simulator.py*<br>
**Running Commands.**<br>
*python3 cache_simulator.py*<br>
**Note:**<br>
I have done all tasks of module-07 of python programming.<br>
